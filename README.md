# Juggling Simulator

This project is a simple juggling simulator built with JavaScript and HTML Canvas. 
It includes a tutorial that guides users through various juggling techniques and patterns.

## Features

- **Interactive Tutorial:** Follow prompts to learn juggling patterns like the cascade, snake, shower, columns, and circular patterns.
- **Customizable Throws:** Experiment with different key presses to vary throw height, hand usage, and throw position.
- **Realistic Physics:** Simulates basic gravity and hand alternation to emulate the physics of juggling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript support.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/encse/juggling.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the simulation.

### Controls

- **Basic Throws:** 
  - Press `S` for a left-hand throw and `D` for a right-hand throw in the cascade pattern.
- **Vary Height:** Use `Q`, `W`, `E`, and `R` for higher throws.
- **Outer Throws:** `A` and `F` produce wider throws for left and right hands, respectively.
- **Quick Throws:** `X` and `C` create low, fast throws for dynamic patterns.
- **CapsLock Mode:** Turns on vertical mode, enabling one-handed juggling styles without holding Shift.

### Tutorial Steps

The tutorial introduces basic and advanced juggling techniques. Youâ€™ll follow prompts to learn and practice:
- The **cascade** (classic alternating hand throw)
- The **shower** (circular motion)
- One-handed patterns
- **Columns** and more complex formations with hand-specific keys.
